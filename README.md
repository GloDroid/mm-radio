## Warning!

## Introduction

The **mm-radio** project is a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the Android operating system that allows communication between the **Modem Manager**
and the **Android** framework. It implements the Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) radio interface and "wires-up" requests to the
Modem Manager service from the [Mobile broadband connectivity community](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mobile-broadband/ModemManager)

It is designed to work on Android 13 and later versions. Older versions do not have AIDL Radio HAL support.

## The implementation details of mm-radio are as follows:

- The `src/radio` directory contains the frontend code for the `IRadio` interface.
- The `src/mm` directory contains C++ wrappers and helpers for the `libmm` library.
- The `src/utils` directory contains various helpers, mostly written in Rust, to support the `mm` and `radio` API connectivity.

## Building mm-radio using AOSPLESS within a Docker container

To build the mm-radio project using the AOSPLESS approach within a Docker container, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker:** Run the following commands to install Docker on your system:

    ```
    $ sudo apt install docker.io
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

- **Note:** Don't forget to reboot your PC to apply group configuration changes.

2. **Clone the project:** Use the following command to clone the mm-radio project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/GloDroid/mm-radio.git
    $ cd mm-radio
    ```

3. **Build the project:** Run the following command to build the project:

    ```
    $ make ci_fast
    ```

- Or, you can run the following command to build and deploy the project to the target device (assuming that some version of mm-radio is already installed on your device):

    ```
    $ make bd
    ```

**Note:**

- If you encounter permission denied errors when running for the first time, try rebooting your device and running the command again.
- To view mm-radio logs after running `make bd`, export the environment variable `export ADBLOG=1`.

## Embedding the mm-radio project into your build

To embed the mm-radio project into your build, you can use the AOSPEXT make scripts to build mm-radio, Modem Manager, and related repositories.

1. **AOSP Manifest:** An example of AOSP Manifest file including mm-radio, Modem Manager and related repositories can be found at: [Link](https://github.com/GloDroid/glodroid_manifest/blob/a12ae690942c9c5bb7ffc2c2d4790300373f26ac/glodroid.xml#L33)
2. **AOSP product configuration changes:** An example of required AOSP product configuration changes can be found at: [Link](https://github.com/GloDroid/glodroid_device/tree/41c92f73619f3e093ff56b458ad99ff0c76b8401/common/modem)
3. **Modem Manager patches:** The Modem Manager project may require additional patches to compile within AOSP. These patches can be found at: [Link](https://github.com/GloDroid/glodroid_device/tree/359da645595b118a1a9c5918638887b5f7d8696a/patches/vendor/modemmanager)
